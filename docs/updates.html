        Today we made structural improvements to the robot and practiced driving. I think that we are well prepared for the competition on Saturday.<br>
        We are one of the most far along robots in the club in terms of autonomous and robot completion.<br>
        But you can never be hopeful.

        Today whe had a competition and we did ok. I am pretty sure that we stayed in top 8 which is all that matters to me.<br>
        We faced V5 robot today and the motors are extremely strong and fast which allows them to be very efficient on the field.<br> 
        They beat us like i'd never seen before. 
      </p>
      <h2 class="c">2.24.19</h2>
      <p class="c">
        On the Friday of the 22nd 7480N the Nubskulls became the first V5 robot in the club.<br> 
        Yesterday multiple other team finished their conversions to V5 with varying success.<br>
        But as they were doing their upgrades, we were working tirelessly on a reliable and repeatable autonomous that we<br>
        completed, firmly planting us at the forefront of innovation in terms of the club. Additionally, we participated in two<br>
        practice matches. We won both of them with autonomous bonus and and a high park in one of the two matches.<br>
